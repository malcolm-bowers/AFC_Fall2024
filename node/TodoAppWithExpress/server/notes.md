RESTRICTIONS
Routes must be
/api/todos
/api/todos/<unique identifier>

DATA
{
    id: Number,
    note: String,
    is_completed: Boolean
}

MUST BE CRUD functional

Read
1) Route - /api/todos, GET method
1.5) Get data from DB
2) JSON
3) Everything Back
4) Array of objects

Create
1) Route - /api/todos, POST method
1.5) Get data from client
1.75) Database sends something back
2) JSON -> client

2) JSON
3) Send back one thing - what was deleted
4) One object

Update
1) Route - /api/todos/<unique>, PUT method
1.5) What are we updating
